# AI-Powered Recommendation System

This project is an AI-powered recommendation system built using TensorFlow.js. It uses machine learning models to provide personalized recommendations to users and explores the potential for integrating Pinterest pins to further enhance the recommendation capabilities.

---

## **Features**
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Provides personalized recommendations based on user data and behavior.
  - Real-time inference using TensorFlow.js for seamless integration into web applications.

- **Enhancements:**
  - Ability to integrate Pinterest pins for richer recommendation contexts.

---

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js and npm installed.
- A modern browser with WebGL support for TensorFlow.js backend.

### **Steps to Install**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/recommendation-system.git
   cd recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Serve the application locally:
   ```bash
   npm run serve
   ```
2. Access the app in your browser

## **Future Enhancement**
### **Improving Accuracy**
To enhance the model's recommendation accuracy:

### **1. Feature Engineering**
- Incorporate more user-specific features like:
  - Demographics
  - Preferences
  - Recent activity
- Extract contextual features from Pinterest pins, such as categories, keywords, and popularity.

### **2. Model Training**
- Use a more complex architecture, such as:
  - Transformer-based models for sequence analysis.
  - Hybrid models combining collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters using grid or random search.

### **3. Data Augmentation**
- Augment datasets by integrating Pinterest metadata to provide richer context for recommendations.
- Use unsupervised learning to cluster similar pins or items.

### **4. Evaluation and Validation**
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets to monitor overfitting.
- Use metrics like Mean Average Precision (MAP), Recall@K, and Precision@K for evaluation.



### **Deployment**

### **1. Local Deployment**
- Use `vite` to build a production-ready bundle:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
## **Future Enhancement**
### **2. Cloud Deployment**
- **Netlify or Vercel:**
  - Directly link the GitHub repository to deploy automatically on updates.
- **AWS Amplify or Firebase Hosting:**
  - Build locally and deploy the `dist` folder to these platforms.


## **Future Enhancement**
### **Inclusion of Pinterest Pins**
Integrating Pinterest pins enhances the recommendation engine by adding a rich dataset of user-curated content. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

### **1. Pinterest API Integration**
- Use the [Pinterest Developers API](https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/getting-started/) to fetch user boards and pins.
- Store and preprocess data, including:
  - Pin descriptions
  - Categories
  - Engagement metrics (likes, shares).

### **2. Feature Extraction**
- Use NLP techniques to extract meaningful keywords from pin descriptions.
- Assign weights to pins based on engagement metrics for prioritization.

### **3. Model Adaptation**
- Merge Pinterest features with user behavior data to create a hybrid recommendation model.
- Update the inference pipeline to include recommendations sourced from Pinterest.

### **4. Testing and Refinement**
- Evaluate the impact of Pinterest integration using A/B testing.
- Fine-tune model parameters to balance recommendations from Pinterest and existing datasets.
